The engine roared as I drove my Porsche away from Berlin at dawn.
I was headed to meet my friend, Dr. Mehlhase, at a Biergarten to catch up over some drinks and bratwurst.
We ordered brot and water as appetizers when we were seated.
By the time we had finished, I felt like my stomach was bursting from my lederhose.
But, that did not stop us from ordering apfelkuchen, which really sealed the deal with my belly.
As I was stuffing my face with food, a sudden bolt of panic shot through me—
Rammstein was set to take the stage in less than an hour at Schloss Eltz.
I quickly finished eating and rushed through the Hauptstrasse to make it on time. 
It was quite wettbewerbsfaehig to make it on time, but I was victorious!
I decided to walk the food off and took a stroll down Hauptstrasse, when suddenly a loose hund ran past me!
Shortly after, i decided to run down to the Schloss that i saw earlier that day!
We were more than full at that point, so we decided to go on a walk down Hauptstraße.
