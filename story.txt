The engine roared as I drove my Porsche away from Berlin at dawn.
I was headed to meet my friend, Dr. Mehlhase, at a Biergarten to catch up over some drinks and bratwurst.
We ordered brot and water as appetizers when we were seated.
By the time we had finished, I felt like my stomach was bursting from my lederhose.
But, that did not stop us from ordering apfelkuchen, which really sealed the deal with my belly.
As I was stuffing my face with food, a sudden bolt of panic shot through me—
Rammstein was set to take the stage in less than an hour at Schloss Eltz.
I quickly finished eating and rushed through the Hauptstrasse to make it on time. 
It was quite wettbewerbsfaehig to make it on time, but I was victorious!
I decided to walk the food off and took a stroll down Hauptstrasse, when suddenly a loose hund ran past me!
Shortly after, i decided to run down to the Schloss that i saw earlier that day!
We were more than full at that point, so we decided to go on a walk down Hauptstraße.
As we sat there laughing, a friendly Hund wandered over from the next table, begging for a piece of our Apfelkuchen with big, pleading eyes.
After that, we went onto the Hauptstrasse to head home.
I think I ate too much now so I think we should call it a day until they played a son by Rammstein so we stayed for longer
All of a sudden, I woke up thousands of miles from my house in a Dirndel without a clue on how I got here.
Thankfully, I had my trusted and loyal hund to ensure that I could get back on track.
