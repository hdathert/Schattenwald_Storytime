The engine roared as I drove my Porsche away from Berlin at dawn.
I was headed to meet my friend, Dr. Mehlhase, at a Biergarten to catch up over some drinks and bratwurst.
We ordered brot and water as appetizers when we were seated.
By the time we had finished, I felt like my stomach was bursting from my lederhose.
But, that did not stop us from ordering apfelkuchen, which really sealed the deal with my belly.
After that, we went to a Rammstein band party held in the Biergarten, where we celebrated a lot, singing and dancing, and at the end of the day, we indulged in some delicious doener to cap off an unforgettable evening.
