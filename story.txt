The engine roared as I drove my Porsche away from Berlin at dawn.
I was headed to meet my friend, Dr. Mehlhase, at a Biergarten to catch up over some drinks and bratwurst.
We ordered brot and water as appetizers when we were seated.
By the time we had finished, I felt like my stomach was bursting from my lederhose.
But, that did not stop us from ordering apfelkuchen, which really sealed the deal with my belly.
As we sat there laughing, a friendly Hund wandered over from the next table, begging for a piece of our Apfelkuchen with big, pleading eyes.
