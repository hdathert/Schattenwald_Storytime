The engine roared as I drove my Porsche away from Berlin at dawn.
I was headed to meet my friend, Dr. Mehlhase, at a Biergarten to catch up over some drinks and bratwurst.
We ordered brot and water as appetizers when we were seated.
By the time we had finished, I felt like my stomach was bursting from my lederhose.
But, that did not stop us from ordering apfelkuchen, which really sealed the deal with my belly.
As I was stuffing my face with food, a sudden bolt of panic shot through meâ€”
Rammstein was set to take the stage in less than an hour at Schloss Eltz.
